# Design Product Test 
## Vanessa Cendales

This is the design made from the wireframe sended by the client. The design is made in FIGMA. I choose a free subject for the design because I want to explore new ideas, more free in concept terms.

It Has two versions: 1-mobile responsive 2-desktop the protopype is included but only animate the buttons hover change and the slider background. Here is the link to access to the main source (view only):
